# Poker Calculator

## Introduction
This project was inspired when we joined an AI Poker tournament. There are a lot of libraries out there that helps you calculate the strength of your hand and one of the more famous ones is Deuces.   

You can find its project page here: [worldveil/deuces](https://github.com/worldveil/deuces)
